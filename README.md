During my bootcamp journey, I undertook a project aimed at providing me with a simplified understanding of the MVVM architecture. In this endeavor, I leveraged data binding to neatly segregate visual elements within both the fragment and activity sections. Subsequently, I refactored our procedural code to reside within a data source, where meaningful operations are conducted. The orchestration of these operations is entrusted to the repository, while the ViewModel assumes the pivotal role of managing the UI. The ViewModel seamlessly communicates with the UI using LiveData, fostering a streamlined data flow.

Looking ahead, when I initiate an operation from the interface, the ViewModel takes charge, orchestrating a sequence that involves interacting with the repository, which, in turn, delegates tasks to the data source. The outcome of this process travels from the data source to the repository, then to the ViewModel, culminating in the delivery of the processed data to the interface.
